"Are you sure? I mean, I've gotten used to wearing it—sort of—when I go visit Wallenstein in his palace. He dresses like a peacock himself and insists everyone does at his little courts. But I'm just going next door!"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Stop whining, Morris," his wife commanded. She stepped back and gave him an admiring look. "<span class="italic">I </span>think you look terrific, myself. This outfit looks a lot better on you than a modern business suit ever did."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She was telling him nothing more than the truth, actually. Judith thought he <span class="italic">did </span>look terrific. Her husband had the kind of sturdy but unprepossessing face and figure that a drab up-time business suit simply emphasized. Whereas that same figure, encased in the clothing worn by seventeenth-century courtiers, looked stately rather than somewhat plump—and it was the shrewdness and intelligence in his face that was brought forward, rather than the plain features, when framed by a lace-fringed falling collar spilling across his shoulders and capped by a broad-brimmed hat. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"The plume, too?" he whined.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"I said, 'stop whining.' Yes, the plume too." She took him by the shoulders, turned him around, and began gently pushing him toward the door of their suite. "Look at it this way, Morris. For years I had to listen to you crab and complain about how much you hated wearing a tie. Now—no ties."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He hadn't quite given up. "Damnation, I'm just going across the street—barely inside the ghetto—to visit Jason in the new community center."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">They were outside the suite that served them as their private quarters, and moving down the hallway toward the great staircase. Judith was no longer actually pushing him ahead of her, but she was crowding him closely enough to force him forward. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Which you have never yet visited," she pointed out. "Not once in the two weeks since it was finished and Jason started working out of it. Even though you paid for the whole thing—buying the building, refurbishing it, and stocking it with what's becoming a very fine library as well as a kitchen for the poor."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Now, they were starting down the stairs. Judith wasn't crowding him quite as closely any longer. Not quite.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"I won't feel comfortable there," he predicted. "Especially not wearing this damn getup. When I went to Hillel House—"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"This is <span class="italic">not </span>Hillel House in Morgantown, Morris," Judith pointed out firmly. "And this is <span class="italic">not </span>the twenty-first century. Everybody in the ghetto knows you're the benefactor who financed the new community center—just like they know you're the source of the not-so-anonymous funds that went to help refurbish the Rathhaus and improve the Old-New Synagogue."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">They'd reached the bottom of the stairs. Morris turned around and planted his hands on his hips, almost glaring at his wife.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Yes? And did they use the money the way I wanted?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Judith gave him a level look, for a moment, before responding. "Yes, as a matter of fact, they did. Avigail and Hirshele thanked me for it just yesterday. They say the seats in the womens' section of the synagogue are much improved—and the air circulation even more so."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">That only made Morris look more sour yet. "Swell. So I'm aiding and abetting 'separate but equal'—which it never is."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">It was Judith's turn to plant her hands on her hips. It was a gesture she did a lot more authoritatively than he did.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Morris, cut it out. You're fifty-three years old and I'm only a year younger than you are. Neither one of us is going to live long enough to see a tenth of the changes you'd like to see—and you know it as well as I do. So what do you say we keep our eyes focused on what's really critical?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She was actually a little angry, she realized, not just putting on an act. "What do you think those Jews are, over there in the Ukraine, whose lives you want to save? A bunch of Mendelssohns and Einsteins and Oppenheimers? Hundreds of thousands of budding Stephen Jay Goulds, champing at the bit to study evolution and biology? They're every bit as set in their ways and customs as the crankiest rabbi here in Prague—a lot more so, in fact. So?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He looked away. "I just don't like it," he murmured.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Judith shook her head. "Husband, I love you dearly but sometimes you are purely maddening. What's <span class="italic">really </span>going on here is that you just have a bad conscience because you know you've hurt Jason's feelings by not showing up sooner at the community center. And now—<span class="italic">men!—</span>you're taking it out on everybody else. Starting with me. So cut it out. Just do your duty and march over there. Wearing your Jewish prince outfit."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She took him by the shoulders and spun him around, facing the door to the street. A servant was standing by, ready to open it. Judith was a bit startled to see him, only realizing now that he would have heard the whole conversation.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">How much of it he would have understood, of course, was another question. So far as she knew, Fischel spoke no English at all. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">So far as she knew—but she'd never asked. Mentally, she shrugged her shoulders. Nothing had been said that would come as any surprise to anyone, after all. Unlike Morris, Judith never let her own attitudes blind her to the fact that seventeenth-century traditional Jews—and certainly their rabbis—were no dummies. By now, months after the Roths had arrived in Prague with a big splash, the people of the ghetto would have made their own assessment of these exotic foreign Jews. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Well, perhaps not "assessment." Not yet, anyway. But Judith was quite sure that she and Morris had been studied very carefully by their servants—and their observations faithfully reported to their rabbis.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Go," she commanded.</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">After Morris left, Judith went to the kitchen—insofar as the term "kitchen" could be used to describe a huge suite of interconnected rooms on the lowest floor devoted to the storing, preparation and serving of food for the inhabitants of a small palace. And not just food for the lord and lady of the mansion, either, and the guests who came to their now-frequent dinners and soirees. Judith was well aware that the midday meal that the cooks and servants made for themselves was their biggest meal of the day—and that they quietly smuggled food out every night, for their families back in the ghetto. Quietly, but not particularly surreptitiously. Judith had made clear to them, long since, that whatever disputes she might have with aspects of their beliefs and customs, she was a firm believer in the Biblical precept about not muzzling the kine that tread the grain.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Avigail, as usual, was tending the big hearth in which the actual cooking was done. Even after the months she'd been in Prague, Judith was still always a little startled to see that hearth, and the profusion of kettles hanging over it and smaller skillets nestled directly in the coals. It was such homely things as the absence of stoves that really drove home to her, more than anything else, that she was now living in a different universe. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Avigail straightened up and smiled at her. "Good morning, gracious lady."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Avigail spoke Yiddish, not German, but Judith had no trouble understanding her. Except for some loan words, the languages were almost identical. The spoken languages, that is. Yiddish was written in Hebrew characters, which Judith couldn't read at all. One of the reasons Judith had hired Avigail was because the woman could read German also, which allowed Judith to leave notes for her when need be.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Now, she wondered what <span class="italic">other </span>languages Avigail might speak. Judith knew the woman was fluent in Czech also. But—</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She blurted it out. In English. A language she had just assumed—without ever asking—would be completely foreign to the cook.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Avigail, do you speak English?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The cook hesitated for a moment. Then, her face a bit stiff, replied in heavily accented but quite understandable English: "Yes, gracious lady. I do."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Judith suddenly realized that the normally-bustling and busy kitchen had fallen very quiet. She scanned the room and saw that all five of the cooks and helpers present were staring at her. All of them with that same, slightly stiff expression.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Do <span class="italic">all </span>of you speak English?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Again, that hesitation. Then, again, nodding heads.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">For a moment, Judith wavered between anger and . . .</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Well . . .</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She burst out laughing. "Does <span class="italic">every </span>servant in this house speak English?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Nods. A bit hastily, Avigail said: "Young Jacob upstairs, not so well." She pointed with a ladle at a teenage girl standing in a corner near the pantry. "And little Rifka over there, even worse. Lazy youngsters, they don't do their studies like they should."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Judith had to fight to bring her laughter under control. "Their 'studies,' no less!"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She shook her head, grinning. "They must have scoured the ghetto to find this many English-speakers. Avigail, if you have any questions—or if the rabbis do—you need only ask. I really have no secrets. Neither does my husband."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">There didn't seem anything else to say. Still grinning, she left the room.</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">After she was gone, Avigail and the three women who'd been employed since the first days after the Roths arrived, turned their heads to regard Rifka. The young woman was new to the household, having only started working there the week before. Their expressions were identical: that of older women finally and fully vindicated in front of skeptical and callow striplings.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"You see?" demanded Avigail. "Did we not tell you?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"I will study harder," Rifka said meekly.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"That's not what I meant!" snapped Avigail. "And you know it perfectly well."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She sniffed, turned away, and went back to work with her ladle. It had a very long handle, because the hearth was large and the fire was hot. But the ladle in Avigail's mind had just grown shorter still. By now, it was not much longer than a spoon.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold">2</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The first thing Morris saw when he entered the community center—the first thing he really noticed, at least, because of his nervousness—was the rabbi standing next to Jason and another young man. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He assumed he was a rabbi, at least. Partly from the clothing the man was wearing, but mostly from certain indefinable things about the way he carried himself—and the very evident respect with which Jason and the other youngster were listening to what he had to say.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris found himself almost gritting his teeth. He had a better knowledge of history, in general, than most residents of Grantville. And because he'd always been especially interested in Jewish history, he had a particularly good knowledge of that subject. He felt like shouting at the three of them: <span class="italic">Your damn rabbinate didn't start running the show until not much more than a thousand years ago! Those old men in Babylon who started throwing their weight around after the destruction of the Second Temple. Our history goes back at least two thousand years earlier than that. Ask David and Solomon—or Abraham and Moshe—if they kowtowed to a bunch of old men with long beards and stupid hats!</span> </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">But, he didn't. It would have been unfairly one-sided, as well as rude and pointless. And, besides . . .</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Well, the fact was that the rabbi in question was not particularly old. In fact, he looked to be younger than Morris himself.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Nothing for it, then. Morris took a deep breath and marched over.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Seeing him come, Jason smiled widely. It was the biggest smile Jason had given Morris in at least two months, and Morris felt himself warming. As Judith had said, since the Ring of Fire Morris had come to look upon young Gotkin as something of an adopted son. The estrangement that had grown between them since their arrival in Prague had been painful.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The rabbi turned his head and regarded Morris. He obviously knew who he was, even though they'd never met. Morris was not surprised. This was not the first time, by any means, that Morris had entered the ghetto. He'd made a number of trips—right into the center of the Josefov—to meet with Dunash and his people. And, every time, although people had not been rude about it, Morris had been quite aware that he'd been carefully and closely observed everywhere he went. And was just as sure that the people who watched him passed on their observations to their rabbis.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">As he neared, the rabbi smiled politely and addressed him. "Good morning, Don Morris. Since I have never had the opportunity, let me take it now to thank you for your generosity in providing for this center. And your many other generosities."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The rabbi's German was excellent, if oddly accented to Morris' ear. By now, Morris' own German was almost fluent. What he found more interesting, though, was the way the rabbi had addressed him. <span class="italic">Don Morris—</span>as if Morris were a Sephardic hidalgo. True, it made a certain sense, because most court Jews in the first half of the seventeenth century were still Sephardic rather than Ashkenazi. Still . . .</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris decided it was a workable compromise, for him as much as the rabbi. Although there were some differences in the way Sephardim and Ashkenazim observed their faith, which resulted in friction and even occasional clashes, neither one of the branches of Judaism considered the other to be heretics. Not to mention that Italian Jews, in this day and age, constituted something of a third tradition of their own.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Truth be told, the friction between Ashkenazim and Sephardim was due more to social factors than religious ones. Sephardim, as a rule, were more comfortable with cultural accommodation to gentile society—and, as a rule, considerably wealthier than most Ashkenazim. So, they tended to look down on Ashkenazim as the equivalent of "country rubes"—a disdain which the Ashkenazim returned in kind, much as Morris' hillbilly neighbors made wisecracks about city slickers. But, since he'd arrived in his new universe, Morris had discovered that the interaction between the two—and with the Judaeo-Italians—was quite a bit more extensive than his study of history had led him to suspect. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Besides, the man was being courteous. Whatever his underlying attitudes, Morris had never found it possible to be rude to someone who was not being rude to him.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He nodded. Graciously, he hoped. "My pleasure, rabbi. Ah—"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"This is Rabbi Spira," Jason said promptly, almost eagerly.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">So. This is the one. </span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris had to fight down a momentary surge of jealousy. Although Jason had been veiled about it, Morris was well aware that the young man had come to develop a deep admiration for Mordechai Spira—and something that bordered on filial respect.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Now that Morris had finally met the man, he could understand that better. As much as Morris was inclined to dislike zealots—and he considered all Orthodox rabbis to be zealots, by their nature—he couldn't miss the intelligence in Spira's eyes. Nor the quite evident warmth and kindliness in them, either. Jason had told him, more than once, that even when Rabbi Spira corrected him for his errors, he invariably did so with good humor. Even wit.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">For Morris Roth, "witty Orthodox rabbi" had always been something of an oxymoron. Unlike Jason, who'd lived in Israel for a year as a student, Morris and Judith had never done more than visit the country for a couple of weeks at a time. Morris had not had much contact with Orthodox Judaism in the United States he'd come from, since his area of the country was dominated by Reform Judaism. So his main personal impression of Orthodox rabbis came from what he'd seen in Israel—which, to him, had been their constant interference in Israel's politics, their narrow-minded obsessions, the readiness with which they threw their political weight around. He'd been particularly angry at their refusal—well, some of them—to allow their adherents to serve in Israel's armed forces, at the same time that they demanded those armed forces be used to carry out policies <span class="italic">they </span>wanted.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He had to remind himself—as Judith reminded him constantly—that they'd left that world behind. There was no Israel in this universe. Not yet, at least; and not for some time to come, if ever. The rabbinate that existed here was one that had been shaped by the life of Jews in central and eastern Europe's ghettos and shtetls. It simply wasn't fair for Morris Roth to pile atop Mordechai Spira's head all the sins of a rabbinate in a different time, in a different universe.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He began to say some words that would have been simply friendly. But he'd barely begun before he heard noises coming from the entrance. The sounds were very faint, seeming to come from a great distance, but Morris thought he recognized them.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Gunshots. Then, a moment later—</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Lots </span>of gunshots.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"It's starting," he said. "Finally."</p><a></a><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold">3</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie leaned back in the chair before the console, and took a deep breath.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Well, Duke, there it is. Finished. Finally."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Wallenstein examined the telephone center, his eyes bright with interest. "And you have the people trained to operate it, yes?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie nodded. "Three, so far. Enough to keep shifts going round the clock—for a while, anyway. You'll need to give them some time off, though, now and then."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Wallenstein was frowning a little, as he often did listening to Ellie's idiosyncratic blend of German and English. Belatedly, she realized that the expression "round the clock" wouldn't have meant much to him. True, they had clocks in the seventeenth century. But the devices were rare and expensive, too much so for their habits to have entered popular idiom yet.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Wallenstein shrugged irritably. "I see no problem." He jerked his head toward a door. "They will sleep here, anyway."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The new telephone center, at Wallenstein's insistence, had been built directly adjoining his personal suite in the palace. He'd even had living quarters connected to it prepared for the eventual telephone operators. Ellie thought that was an odd arrangement. But, given Wallenstein's shaky health—not to mention the terrible wounds that Julie Mackay had inflicted upon him at the Alte Veste, which he would never fully recover from even with the help of American medical care—she could understand it. Wallenstein had to spend a lot of his time, now, resting in his bed. But with a telephone literally at his fingertips, he would have the wherewithal to continue managing the empire he intended to build for himself. Ellie and Len had already built and put in place a direct phone connection between Wallenstein's bed in his private room and the telephone center itself.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">By now, Ellie had gotten to know Wallenstein well enough not to be afraid to contradict him. The Duke of Friedland was insistent upon his privileges, and had a very harsh way with anyone who was impolite to him. But he did not bridle at being opposed over a matter of substance, as long as it was done respectfully and not too insistently. And, fortunately, he cut more slack for Ellie than he did for just about anyone else except his wife Isabella and his nurse, Edith Wild. And Pappenheim, of course.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie shook her head. "Duke, this is not that simple a system to operate. It takes a lot of mental alertness—at least, assuming you wind up using it as often as you think you will. What I mean is—"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">There was an interruption at the door. More precisely, in the large room beyond that served Wallenstein's private suite as an entry salon. A man was pushing his way in, overriding the protests of the guard stationed at the entrance to the suite. There seemed to be several men standing in the corridor beyond, as well.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie recognized him. It was Eugen Rossbach—<span class="italic">Ritter </span>Rossbach, as he insisted on being called—one of the mercenary captains who had attached himself to Wallenstein's service. Wallenstein was rather partial to the man. Ellie despised him, herself—but then, admittedly, Ellie despised most of the mercenaries who surrounded the Duke of Friedland. Perhaps oddly, Pappenheim—in some ways the most frightening of them all—was the one she disliked the least.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Wallenstein, now frowning fiercely, stepped out of the small telephone center into the main salon. "What is it, Rossbach? I am occupied at the moment."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Rossbach, still fending off the protesting guard with one hand, waved a document with the other. "Yes, my apologies—but you must see this immediately! It's from the emperor!"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie rose and came to the doorway. Wallenstein took a step forward to take the message, which Rossbach extended toward him.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">It suddenly dawned on Ellie that the three men with Rossbach were coming into the main salon, now that the guard was distracted. <span class="italic">Why?</span> </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">One of them—then the other two—reached for their swords. Without thinking, Ellie grabbed Wallenstein by his collar and yanked him backward.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The Duke cried out in protest. Rossbach snarled. Then—Ellie never saw the stabbing itself—the guard suddenly screamed and staggered forward. Behind him, as he fell to his knees, she could see one of Rossbach's companions with his sword now in his hand. The tip of it was covered in blood.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Wallenstein cried out again. A curse of some sort, Ellie thought. Rossbach shouted something, dropped the document and drew his own sword.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie hauled Wallenstein back into the telephone room. He stumbled on the way and fell backward, landing on his rump. She just had time to slam the door shut in Rossbach's face.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Then, fumbled to find the lock which—</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Didn't exist. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Goddamit! </span>There'd been no reason, after all, to put a lock on that door. In fact, Wallenstein would have been furious if they'd done so. It was <span class="italic">his </span>telephone center, not that of the men who would be operating it for him.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She heard Rossbach's fist slamming the door. Then, a moment later, a much heavier <span class="italic">wham </span>as his boot slammed into it.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie's fear and fury were, for a moment, penetrated by an absurd impulse to cackle with laughter. <span class="italic">That idiot Rossbach thinks the door IS locked.</span> </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">But it probably wouldn't take him long to figure it out. And besides—another <span class="italic">wham—</span>even if he didn't, that door wasn't really that solid. He'd be able to kick it in easily enough.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Wallenstein was now rising to his feet. Unfortunately, in his own personal suite, the Duke wasn't carrying his sword. They were both unarmed.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Bullshit!" Ellie snarled. She stooped over and rummaged through the big tool chest that had been in the room for weeks now. An instant later, she came up with a modern Crescent wrench—Len's 12-incher—as well as the two-foot cheater pipe he used for extra leverage when he needed it. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She tossed the pipe to Wallenstein and hefted the wrench. It wasn't much, but it would have to do.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Wham! </span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Wham!—</span>and the door came off the hinges. Rossbach and another man started pushing through the doorway, their swords level.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">WHAM! WHAM! </span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Both of them sailed through the opening, as if shot from a cannon, their swords flying out of their hands. Wallenstein clubbed Rossbach down, but Ellie missed the other man. Her swing had been wild, accompanied by a shriek of fear as she dodged the sword sailing ahead of him. Now it was her turn to fall on her ass.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">It didn't matter, though. The swing had been more of a reflex than anything else. She'd seen the erupting exit wound on the man's belly. That <span class="italic">WHAM </span>had been a gunshot.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She stared through the open, shattered doorway. She could see Edith Wild standing in the salon, now. The big woman's face was contorted with anger and she was holding a modern-style revolver in both hands. The two remaining assassins were out of Ellie's range of view. But she could just imagine how astonished they were. Ellie was astonished herself.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">WHAM! WHAM! </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Now that Ellie wasn't completely overwhelmed by adrenalin, the sound of the gunshots seemed ten times louder. Edith must have been nearly deafened. Each shot from the short-barreled revolver was accompanied by a bright yellow muzzle flash. The gun bucked in Edith's big hands—so badly that Ellie was pretty sure the second shot had gone wild.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">But Edith didn't seemed fazed at all. The snarl stayed on her face and she brought the gun back into line. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"The Tatar," indeed. Don't fuck with Nurse Ratchett. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie heard a man shout something. A protest of some kind, perhaps, or a plea for mercy.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Fat lot of good it did him. <span class="italic"><span class="bold">WHAM!</span></span> </p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie shook her head to clear it. When she looked up again, Edith was no longer in sight. Hearing some sort of noise—she couldn't really tell what it was, her ears were ringing so badly—Ellie scrambled over on her hands and knees and stuck her head out the door.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Edith's last shot had gone a little wild too, it seemed. The man had only been wounded in the shoulder—from what Ellie could tell, nothing more than a flesh wound—and Edith's gun was out of ammunition.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Fat lot of good it did him. <span class="italic">Don't fuck with Nurse Ratchett. </span>Edith had wrestled him to the floor and was now clubbing his head with her revolver.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump. </span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Wallenstein stuck his own head out the door, crouched a little higher than Ellie. "Rossbach is dead," he announced.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He studied Edith at her work for a moment, then straightened and helped Ellie to her feet. When she looked at him again, to her surprise, Wallenstein was smiling thinly and stroking his badly scarred jaw.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"A pity there are so few American women," he announced. "If I had an army of you mad creatures, I could conquer the world."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Pappenheim charged into the salon, his sword in his hand. Behind him came at least half a dozen soldiers. When he saw Wallenstein, obviously unhurt, the relief on his face was almost comic. It was odd, really—not for the first time, the thought came to Ellie—how much devotion a man like Wallenstein could get from a man like Pappenheim. She didn't think she'd ever really understand it.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">But, she didn't need to. The fact itself was enough. Wallenstein was still alive and kicking and now Pappenheim was on the scene. Which meant that—finally—all hell was about to break loose.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Best stop her, Gottfried," said Wallenstein, pointing to Edith. The nurse was still clubbing the would-be assassin, though he was now completely limp and lying on the floor. "It would help if we could get him to talk."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Even ferocious Pappenheim seemed a little daunted by the project. After a moment's hesitation, he sheathed his word and walked over, taking care to remain outside of Edith's reach.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He knelt to bring himself into her field of view and gave Edith his most winning smile. Which, on Pappenheim's face, looked about as out of place as anything Ellie could imagine. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He extended his hand in a carefully nonthreatening plea for restraint. "<span class="italic">Bitte,</span> Frau. We need the man to talk."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Edith let up on her thumping and glared at Pappenheim. Then, gave the assassin one final thump and rose heavily to her feet. "All right. But he better never try it again."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Pappenheim studied the man's bloody head. "No fear of that, I think."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Now Isabella came piling into the room, shrieking with fear, and practically leaped into her husband's arms. As he comforted her, Wallenstein gave Ellie a meaningful glance.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Yes, boss," she muttered. She went back into the telephone center and started making the connections.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">As Ellie expected, it wasn't long before Wallenstein came in. He was a considerate husband, but some things that man would always insist on doing himself.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"The first time it is used," he confirmed. "I will do so, and no other."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie had already made the connection to the barracks adjoining Wallenstein's palace where he kept his trusted officers and troops. (Except Pappenheim and the <span class="italic">most </span>trusted ones—they lived in the palace.) Len was handling the phone center in the barracks itself, and they'd had time to exchange a few words.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Wallenstein leaned over and spoke into the tube. "Do it," was all he commanded.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Pappenheim crowded in, giving the telephone equipment no more than an interested glance. "I will see to Marradas myself."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Make sure there's not another miracle, Gottfried."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The smile that now came to Pappenheim's face didn't look out of place at all.</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie never saw it herself, since she spent the next many hours closeted in the telephone center. But she heard about it. In the famous "defenestration of Prague" that had been the incident usually cited as the trigger for the Thirty Years War, the Catholic Habsburg envoys thrown out of a high window in Prague Castle by rebellious Protestant noblemen had landed in a pile of manure. Their survival had been acclaimed as a miracle by the Catholic forces and had been disheartening to the Protestant rebels.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Marradas fell about the same distance—seventy feet—after Pappenheim threw him out of a window in the castle. But, as commanded, there was no second miracle. Marradas landed on a pile of stones on the street below—placed there by Pappenheim's soldiers at his command, while Pappenheim kept the screaming and struggling Spanish don pinned in his grip for ten minutes until the work was finished.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold">4</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie heard about it from Morris Roth, who had watched it happen—at a distance, through binoculars, from the room in the uppermost floor of his mansion that gave him the best vantage point. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris had gone back to his mansion as soon as he realized the coup was underway. Jason had followed him along with, somewhat to Morris' surprise, Mordechai Spira. The rabbi had not even taken the precaution of wearing the special badge that Jews were required to wear under Habsburg law whenever they left the ghetto. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">For the first few hours, it was hard to tell exactly what was happening. Morris had tried to reach Len and Ellie with the CB radios they'd brought with them to Prague, but there was no answer. That meant neither of them were in their private rooms in Wallenstein's palace. They always left their CB there, hidden in one of their chests, since the existence of the radios was supposed to be a secret from their new allies. None of them really thought that Wallenstein was fooled any, but since he also never raised the issue, they'd decided that maintaining discretion was the best policy. Soon enough, no doubt, now that the conflict was out in the open, Wallenstein would start pressuring his American allies to provide him with more in the way of technological advancement. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">But their protracted failure to answer was enough by itself to confirm Morris' guess. That had to mean that both of them were busy in the new phone centers, which Wallenstein would be using to coordinate the first stages of his coup d'etat.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The defenestration of Marradas took place early in the afternoon. A few short minutes later, a new standard began appearing, draped over the walls of every prominent building on the Hradcany—even the cathedral. Morris didn't recognize it, but he was sure it was the new coat of arms that Wallenstein had designed for himself. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Duke of Friedland, Prince of Sagan—and now, King of Bohemia and Moravia. </span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris lowered the binoculars. "Well, that's it. For the moment, anyway."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He heard Mordechai Spira clear his throat. "We will not take sides in this, Don Morris. None of us have any love for the Habsburgs, but . . . Wallenstein . . . It was he, you know, who had poor Jacob Stein guarded by dogs under the gallows while he extorted eleven thousand florins from us."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Yes, I know. But the fact was that Stein had broken the law—even if unwittingly—and there are plenty of goyishe princes who would have executed him <span class="italic">after </span>squeezing the silver from us. And it is also a fact that Wallenstein eventually exonerated Hanok ben Mordechai Altschul, who had also been accused, when many a goyishe prince—most of them—would never have bothered distinguishing a guilty Jew from an innocent."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He turned his head and looked at Spira. The rabbi's eyes were a little wide. "You know the history of it?" he asked, obviously surprised.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"I know a great deal of history," Morris said harshly. He was on the verge of uttering some bitter phrases—more than phrases, entire paragraphs—on the ineffectual role generally played by Orthodox rabbis when the Nazi Holocaust swept over eastern Europe's Jewry.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">But, thankfully, he managed to swallow them. Mordechai Spira seemed a well-meaning man, and young Jason liked and admired him—and, most of all, it was simply unfair to blame a man or even a group of men for the faults and failures of other men in a completely different time and place.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"I know a great deal of history," Morris repeated, but this time softly, almost sighing the words. "I only wish I knew what to do with that knowledge."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Inadvertently, his eyes drifted eastward. Spira's eyes followed his gaze.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"You are worried about the Ukraine, I know. Jason has told me."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Will you help me, then?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The rabbi hesitated, but not for more than a second or two. "I will do everything I can, Don Morris, which I feel I can do in good conscience."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris thought about it. "I guess I can live with that."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He went back to studying the city with his binoculars. "I do not know what is going to happen now, Rabbi. But you are not pacifists."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"No, we are not."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"You will defend the ghetto, whether or not you take sides in this business." It was a command, not a question. "I do not know if there will be trouble, but there may be. Not from Wallenstein or Pappenheim, but the Habsburgs. Or, for that matter, who knows what Holk and his butchers will do, when they get the news."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Yes," replied Spira. "We will do our best, at least. Though we have no weapons beyond tools and kitchen knives."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris chuckled, and lowered the binoculars. "That's what you think. Show him, Jason."</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ten minutes later, Mordechai Spira's eyes were wider yet. Jason and Dunash's people—who'd arrived at the Morris mansion just moments earlier—were hauling the muskets out of the crates in the basement and stacking them against the walls. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"I was able to bring two hundred, which was all Mike Stearns told me he could spare," Morris explained. "These are the new flintlocks. You'll need to have Jason explain how they work. They're not really much different from matchlocks, just better. I assume that in a ghetto of some fifteen thousand people, there have to be at least a few hundred who've handled firearms before."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Spira nodded. "Oh, yes. Many are here from the small villages, where things are less regulated. And there are at least a few dozen former seamen."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"We can help too!" Dunash said eagerly.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris glared at him. "You <span class="italic">are </span>taking sides in this business, young man—and you have commitments already. Red and Billek are counting on you to man the katyusha. So get your ass out of here."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Dunash hesitated. But Jason spoke up, very firmly. "Do as he says, Dunash. All of you."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The young Abrabanel firebrands and their new recruits—there were almost twenty of them, now—immediately left. The rabbi turned his head to watch them go, before bringing his gaze to Jason. It was almost as he were examining him.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Then, he smiled. "I have great hopes for you, young man. I think you will make a splendid rabbi."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Now he looked at Jason's chevrusah. "Spread the word, Schmuel. We want only men who know how to use guns. No point in trying to teach complete novices."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">After Schmuel raced out, Spira chuckled. "Such as myself. Tell me, Don Morris, are you familiar with guns?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Before answering him—by way of answer, rather—Morris went to another crate and drew out a different weapon. This one, unlike the others, was encased in a fancy covering rather than simple cloth. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He unzipped the guncase and drew out the rifle. "This is a much better gun than those flintlocks, Rabbi. I've owned it for many years. It is called—well, never mind. Yes, I know how to use it. I was a soldier in the American army, some years ago. In fact, I'm quite a good shot."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Spira seemed to be examining him, now. Morris shifted his shoulders uncomfortably. "Look, Rabbi, it's not just my military training. In the world I came from my wife and children and I were the only Jews in our town. And it's a mountain country town, where everybody hunts."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He looked down at the rifle, caressing the sleek stock. "The strange thing about it—perhaps—is that I never actually hunted myself. Hunting is not part of our traditions and customs."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Spira nodded. "No, it is not. We may only eat meat which has been properly slaughtered by a schohet."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris smiled wryly; almost bitterly. "Ah, yes, all those rules. Most of which I do not agree with but still often find it hard to ignore completely. Like hunting." He raised the rifle a bit, as if starting to bring it to his shoulder, and then lowered it again.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"But, you see, Rabbi . . . it would have been standoffish for me not to join my friends in their favorite sport. So, I did, even though I never shot any deer. I just went along. I always enjoyed the outdoors anyway. And—I don't know—I suppose just in order to prove that the reason I didn't wasn't because—well—"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He shifted his shoulders again. "I was one of the best shots on the rifle range and everybody knew it. So my friends—yes, gentile friends, I had lots of them—still do—would tease me about it. But not much, and not hard, and only in fun."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He gave Spira something of a challenging stare. Spira looked away, but Morris didn't think it was because the rabbi was afraid of the challenge, or trying to avoid it.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"There are many wise and wonderful sayings in the midrash, Don Morris. 'When in a city, follow its customs' is one of them."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris swallowed. He'd heard that one before, from his rabbi Steve Stern, in a universe now impossible to reach.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Spira brought his gaze back. "But I think there is perhaps an even more apt saying—though not from the midrash. It is one of your American folk sayings, Jason tells me."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The rabbi gestured toward the west, where, faintly, the sounds of fighting could still be heard across the river. "We will not takes sides in this affair. But, however it is settled, we will be guided by the wisdom of the ancient Babylonian sage Schmuel. <span class="italic">'The law of the kingdom is the law.'</span> That will suffice for you, I think, in the immediate period."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Yeah," Morris gruffed. "I can live with that. For a while, at least. So can Wallenstein."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Spira nodded. "And, in the meantime, Don Morris—"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"I prefer to be called just 'Morris,' " he stated abruptly.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Spira nodded again. "As you wish. And, in the meantime, Morris . . . don't be a stranger."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">With that, smiling, the rabbi turned away and headed for the stairs. "Now," he said over his shoulder, "I'd best see after young Schmuel—who is no sage. Indeed, he can be excessively enthusiastic. Please come with me, Jason, I could use your help."</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris stayed alone in the basement after they left, silent, for perhaps five minutes. Then he began loading the rifle. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Did you think it was going to be simple?" he muttered to himself. "You dummy."</p><a></a><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Chapter V: Castling</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">July, 1633</span></span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_3"><span class="bold">1</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">For the next two days, while Wallenstein and Pappenheim fought a chaotic and swirling series of small battles in and around Prague with military units who opposed the rebellion—or simply wanted to remain neutral, which Wallenstein wasn't going to tolerate—Morris Roth remained in his mansion. He stayed on the uppermost floor most of the time, except for brief snatches of sleep; moving from window to window, rifle in his hands, keeping watch on the streets below. He hadn't planned it that way—certainly Len and Ellie hadn't, when they purchased the building on his behalf—but because of its location just outside one of the main gates in the ghetto wall, his mansion served the Josefov as something in the way of a ravelin. An exterior little fortress from which enfilade fire could be brought to bear on anyone attempting to assault the fortress itself.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He only used the rifle once, during those two days. That was on the evening of the first day, just before sundown, when a small band of ruffians—possibly soldiers operating on their own, possibly just criminals; it was hard to tell—advanced toward the ghetto brandishing a haphazard collection of swords, pikes and arquebuses. Morris warned them off when they were fifty yards away. When the only response he got was a small volley of arquebus fire that did no damage at all beyond making a few pockmarks in the thick walls of the mansion, he shot three of them. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">One round each, good center mass shots. Not hard to do, at that range, especially for a good shot like Morris. All of them fell in the street, in the space of less than ten seconds. The rest promptly fled. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">One man had been killed instantly; the other two were mortally wounded, dying within minutes. One of the men managed to crawl perhaps twenty feet before he finally collapsed.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris slept hardly at all that night. Early in the morning, Judith found him back at his post, rifle held firmly in his grip. He avoided her eyes, though, when she approached and placed her hand on his shoulder.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Talk to me, Morris."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"What's there to say?" he asked, shrugging. "I'm a small-town jeweler who hasn't even been in a fist fight since I was a kid in boot camp. Over thirty years ago. Yeah, sure, I was in Vietnam. Big deal. I spent my whole tour of duty as a supply clerk in the big army base at Long Binh, and I didn't get there until long after the Tet Offensive."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">While he spoke, his eyes kept ranging across the streets below, looking for possible threats. He never looked at Judith once. "I guess you could call it 'combat duty,' since I always knew that some of the explosions and shots I heard during the night was stuff aimed into the base rather than our own Harassment and Interdiction fire. But nothing ever landed close to me—and I never once had to fire my own weapon at any enemies I could see." Very softly: "I've never even shot a deer before, much less a man. Then stare at their bodies afterward, while they bleed to death."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Judith gave his shoulder a little squeeze; then, disappeared for a while. When she returned, she had Mordechai Spira in tow along with another rabbi who seemed to be a close friend of his. A man by the name of Isaac Gans. The two of them kept Morris company the rest of the day. There was little conversation, because Morris was not in a mood for talking. Still, he appreciated their presence. Not so much for anything they said or did, but just for the fact of it. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Neither Spira nor Gans was wearing Jewish insignia. During the afternoon of the day before, just a short time before Morris had his confrontation with the band of thugs, a small squad of soldiers led by a sub-officer had placed posters on buildings near the ghetto—as well as two posters flanking the entrance to the ghetto itself. The posters were proclamations by Wallenstein. The first proclamation announced that he was now the king of Bohemia—and Pappenheim was the duke of Moravia.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">There were many proclamations on those posters. Among them, Wallenstein had kept the promise he'd made to Morris long months before, in a small house in Grantville. Freedom of religion was guaranteed. Distinctions between citizens (that was a new word, just in itself—<span class="italic">citizens</span>)<span class="italic">
</span>would no longer take religious affiliation into account. And, specifically, all restrictions on Jews were abolished.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">It was pretty impressive, actually. At least, the words were. A lot of the language was cribbed from texts of the American Revolution as well as the <span class="italic">Declaration of the Rights of Man </span>adopted in 1789 by the National Assembly during the French Revolution. One, in particular, was taken word-for-word from the French declaration:</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including his religious views, provided their manifestation does not disturb the public order established by law. </span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">True enough, there was wiggle room there, if Wallenstein chose to exercise it. "Disturb the public order" could become a weasel phrase easily enough, in the hands of an autocrat.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Which Wallenstein would be. His proclamations, needless to say, did not include the <span class="italic">political </span>aspects of the French and American declarations. The rights and liberties of citizens would be respected—or so, at least, Wallenstein proclaimed. But political power would remain in the hands of the new king. There was a provision for the formation of a National Assembly, but it was obvious that Wallenstein intended it to remain purely advisory.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">So be it. What Wallenstein intended was one thing; what eventually resulted, another. And, in the meantime, at least Jews no longer had to wear badges or distinctive yellow hats whenever they left the ghetto. They could build synagogues anywhere in Prague—in all of Bohemia and Moravia, in fact—and could henceforth own the guns to protect them, if need be.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">There was one part of the proclamation that almost made Morris laugh. Wallenstein had also ordered the dismantling of the wall of the ghetto. And, sure enough, Dunash and his firebrands immediately began eagerly tearing down one little section of the wall near the quarter of the ghetto where they lived—ignoring the protests of most of their neighbors.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Their <span class="italic">Jewish </span>neighbors, for whom the wall was something of a comfort as well as a curse. The neighbors had even gone to register a protest with the rabbis.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The chief rabbi had hemmed and hawed. But most of the other rabbis—led by Spira and Gans, according to Jason—decided soon enough that the wisdom of the ancient Babylonian sage still applied: <span class="italic">The law of the land is the law.</span> </p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">So, Dunash and his men had been able to proceed in the work cheerfully and unmolested.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">But only for two days. In midafternoon of the third day, having established their control of Prague itself, Wallenstein and Pappenheim took most of their soldiers out of the city, marching to the southwest, to meet an oncoming army dispatched by Ferdinand II.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">There was to be a second Battle of the White Mountain, it seemed. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The day after Wallenstein and Pappenheim left, Holk—who had been ordered to guard the northern frontier against any possible Saxon interference—announced that he was marching into Prague instead. "To secure the city from disorders," he was reported to have said. Or words to that drunken effect.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Whether he had decided to throw his lot in with Emperor Ferdinand, or simply couldn't resist the opportunity to loot a major city, no one knew. To the inhabitants of Prague, it hardly mattered. Not even the still-considerable body of residents who were Habsburg loyalists wanted Holk around. Nobody in their right mind, except his own thugs, wanted Holk anywhere nearby.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris got the news from Red Sybolt and Jan Billek.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Is it true?" he asked.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Seems to be," said Billek. "There is already a small stream of refugees coming into the city from the north. They believe it, certainly—that is why they are trying to get out of Holk's path."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris leaned out the window, scowling toward the north. "What does Holk think he's doing?<span class="italic">
</span>If Wallenstein wins, he's dead meat."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Does Holk 'think' at all?" Red shrugged. "He's a drunk and a thug, Morris. For all we know, he<span class="italic">
</span>didn't decide anything at all. Maybe his own soldiers put him up to it, and he doesn't dare refuse them. Sacking a big city like Prague when it's got no real army to defend it is the kind of opportunity every mercenary dreams about in the Thirty Years War. Look at it from their point of view. At the very least, they'll have two or three days to plunder and pillage before Wallenstein and Pappenheim get back and they have to run for it. You think the average mercenary—sure as hell in Holk's army—thinks in the long run? 'Planning for the future' for guys like that means 'gimme what I want—now.' "</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris brought his head back, still scowling. "All right. It'll be up to you and Jan, then. Wallenstein didn't leave more than a thousand soldiers here. Good thing he didn't take your Brethren volunteers with him, too."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Red smiled lopsidedly. "Pappenheim still doesn't trust us. Not our loyalty, just how much use we'd be in a battle. He's more set in his ways than Wallenstein, you know—and with Wallenstein in the shape he's in, Pappenheim will have to do the actual commanding on the battlefield."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris' smile was even more lopsided than Red's. "I never thought I'd say this, but I really wish—<span class="italic">really </span>wish—Wallenstein had stayed behind. What a world! To think I'd ever find Wallenstein's presence a comfort." He shook his head. "But . . . there it is. I surely would."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He glanced up at the Hradcany. "What about the soldiers he did leave behind?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Oh, I think we can count on them, well enough," Billek assured him. "Pappenheim left one of his protégés in charge—young Kastner, I do not think you know him. His unit is one of the best, actually. Wallenstein and Pappenheim want something to return to, assuming they win their battle. There are still plenty of Habsburg loyalists in the population, especially among the Catholics."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Why'd they take almost everybody with them, then?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Morris, be realistic," said Sybolt. "If you were Wallenstein, you'd do the same thing. If he loses this upcoming battle against the Austrians, he's finished. He's burned all his bridges behind him, now. It's not as if he figured on Holk running wild, after all—and even if he did consider the possibility, so what? If Wallenstein whips the Austrians and comes back to a wrecked and plundered Prague, he's <span class="italic">still </span>the king of Bohemia. Cities can be rebuilt, too, you know. Look at Magdeburg."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris took a deep breath and let it out slowly. "True. Tough on the people living in the city, though."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Yup. Unless they protect themselves. Speaking of which, what are your orders?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"<span class="italic">My </span>orders?" Morris stared at him. "I'm not in charge here."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Red chuckled. "Morris, sometimes you're a real babe in the woods. What does 'in charge' have to do with anything? Nobody put Holk 'in charge' either—but he's still on his way."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Sybolt stepped up to the window and studied the Hradcany for a moment. "Kastner's just a youngster, Morris. He hasn't got the confidence to take charge of the whole city. What he'll do is fort up in the castle and the key buildings in the Malá Strana below the hill—including Wallenstein's palace, of course—and just be satisfied with fending Holk off."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"He is right," said Billek. "And Holk will make no real effort to take the Hradcany. He and his men are looking for loot, not a protracted siege." He came forward and joined Sybolt at the window, examining the city. "From the direction they are coming, they will strike Prague on the west bank of the Vltava first. Then, they will recoil from Kastner's men in the Hradcany and the Malá Strana and head for Stone Bridge. Most of Prague is on this side of the river. Not the richest part, to be sure, but Holk and his men are not fussy looters. And this is the soft part of the city."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Billek glanced at the two rabbis standing not far away. The faces of both Spira and Gans were calm enough, but tight with worry. "Especially the Josefov. Jews are not armed and everyone knows it. They will begin their plunder and ravages in Old Town and move north to the ghetto."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris was no military man, but, as he studied the layout of the city, he decided that Red and Jan were right. Given the nature of Holk and his army, that was exactly what they'd do.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"We should try to trap them on the Stone Bridge," he said abruptly. "Never let them get across at all."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Then a bit startled by the sureness with which he'd spoken, Morris added: "I think."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Well, so do I," said Red. "So does Jan—we talked about it on our way over here. Good thing we've got a smart boss."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Who made me the 'boss'?" Morris demanded. "I still don't understand—"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Billek interrupted him. That was unusual, for the normally reserved and polite leader of the Brethren. "Do not be stupid, Morris," he said forcefully. "<span class="italic">Don Morris, </span>rather."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Billek nodded toward the two rabbis. "The only way this plan will work is if the Jews hold the eastern side of the bridge and keep Holk pinned on it. While we Brethren and Red's CoC volunteers hammer them from fortified positions in the Malá Strana. We have most of the guns and will do most of the killing. But the eastern end of the bridge <span class="italic">must </span>be held—and firmly."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Spira and Gans looked startled. Billek shook his head. "As Red says, we must be realistic here. Who else <span class="italic">except </span>the Jews will hold the eastern end of the bridge from Holk—hold it at all, much less firmly? Except for the Brethren, the Christian population on the east side of the river is still confused and uncertain. They won't fight—not most of them—not against such as Holk. They will simply flee the city."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris felt his jaws tighten. "Whereas the Jews don't have any place to run to. If they try to leave the city, in this chaos, they'd likely be plundered by"—he almost said <span class="italic">the stinking goyishe villagers on the way</span>, but didn't—"you know, everybody. Just about."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Billek said nothing. After a moment, to Morris' surprise, Red grinned cheerfully. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Hey, Morris, look at it this way—it happened once before, didn't it? Well, in a manner of speaking."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris couldn't help but smile himself. <span class="italic">Talk about a topsy-turvy world! </span>In the universe they'd come from, in the year 1648, a Swedish army had marched into Prague and taken the Hradcany and the Malá Strana on the west bank of the river. Convinced that they'd do better even under the heavy hand of the Habsburgs than at the hands of a conquering Swedish army—by the end of the Thirty Years War, Swedish armies were no more disciplined than anybody's—the Jews of Prague's ghetto had joined with Catholic students and burghers to fight off the Swedes when they tried to cross the Stone Bridge and pillage the eastern half of the city. It had been the last major battle of the Thirty Years War, in fact. It didn't end until nine days after the Peace of Westphalia was signed—and the Swedes never did make it across the bridge.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Less than a hundred years later, under Empress Maria Theresa, the Habsburgs repaid the loyalty of Prague's Jewry by expelling them from the city.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Right," Morris growled, his smile fading. "Let's do it again—and we'll hope, this time, it turns out better in the long run."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He turned away from the window and faced the two rabbis. "Will you agree?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Spira and Gans looked at each other. Spira nodded. Gans shrugged. "Do we have a choice? Not that I can see. And I am sure all the other rabbis will agree."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"You will be in command, yes, Don Morris?" asked Spira. He gave Billek and Red a somewhat apologetic glance. "Our people will follow you. Not . . . others."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"See?" Red demanded, smiling wider than ever. "Like I said, you're the boss."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Make sure you are on a horse," Billek added. "Biggest horse you can find. And wear something suitable."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold">2</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris had been prepared for a brawl with Dunash. He was sure the young militant would try to insist that he and his men should remain with the other Jews on the east bank, rather than fighting with the Brethren as they were supposed to do.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">But, to his surprise, Red Sybolt scuttled the problem before it could even emerge.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"We may as well keep me and Dunash and the katyusha on this side anyway, Morris. Those rockets are about as accurate as spitting in the wind. If we fire them at the bridge from the Malá Strana, we're as likely to kill our own people over here as Holk's people on the bridge."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Red pointed across the river. "The Brethren will be sheltered in fortified positions over there. At the beginning, for sure. So they'll be safe enough from friendly fire, since those warheads really aren't that powerful. We designed them as antipersonnel weapons. A small charge and a lot of shrapnel, basically."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Jan's okay with that?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Yeah, he and I already talked it over." Red's easy grin was back. "Besides, the truck's in your basement, remember? That was the only place secret enough to assemble it under Wallenstein's nose. Well, under Marradas' nose. I'm pretty sure Wallenstein knows we have the thing. It'll be hard enough to haul it out of there, much less try to get it across the river and under shelter. The Malá Strana doesn't have too much in the way of garages, you know."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">After he thought it over, Morris decided Red was right. If nothing else, even if the katyusha proved ineffective in the battle, just having a fabled American war machine show up in the midst of the motley "army" assembling on the eastern end of the bridge would do wonders for morale. Especially with Jews manning the thing.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Besides, he was tiring of fighting with Dunash.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Okay, done."</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He had a bigger problem with the horse. Big enough that he even lapsed into profanity for a moment. "Where the hell did you get this thing? I didn't think Clydesdales even existed in this day and age." A little whine came into his voice. "And how am I supposed to even get onto it, anyway? Especially wearing this stupid getup. With a winch?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He was coming to detest Red's grin. "Why not? According to a movie I saw once, that's how the old knights got lifted onto their horses." Red gave the horse in question an admiring look. "And quit exaggerating. It's not a Clydesdale, not even close. Just the second biggest horse Pappenheim owns. He took the biggest one with him."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris grimaced. "Oh, swell. Now I'll have Pappenheim furious with me, on top of everything else. Do they hang horse thieves in Bohemia? I'm sure they do."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Red shrugged. "If you keep Prague intact, I really don't think Pappenheim's going to mind much that you used one of his horses to do it. Look, Morris. Nobody ever said being a champion wasn't risky."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Champion." Oh, swell. Like I need a hole in the head. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Gloomily, Morris went back to studying the horse. He was a good horseman, to be sure—within the limits of what "good horsemanship" meant for an American whose experience was almost entirely with the sort of horses one encountered on riding trails and pack stations. Whether that would translate into being able to control a seventeenth-century warhorse . . .</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">A bit to his surprise, it did. The warhorse was more spirited than Morris was accustomed to, but on the other hand it had been trained to remain steady in the middle of a battlefield. Once he got accustomed to it, in fact, he found himself enjoying the experience. It really was quite a horse.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">And, there was no doubt of one thing: as silly as he felt, riding a horse while wearing the fancy garb of a seventeenth-century nobleman, his appearance before the crowd now erecting barricades at the eastern end of the Stone Bridge had an impact. He even got cheered. A very big cheer, in fact. Jason had told Judith that the story was already widely spread of how Don Morris had slain goyishe bandits seeking to victimize the ghetto, with his powerful American arquebus. As many as ten bandits, in one version of the story. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">As big a cheer as it was, though, it was not as big as the cheer the katyusha received, when Red and Dunash's people finally managed to get it out of the basement—they used dozens of people with ropes to just <span class="italic">lift </span>it out—and Red drove it slowly forward onto the little square abutting the bridge.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris was startled when the initial cheer evolved into a chant: <span class="italic">APC! APC! </span>He wouldn't have guessed that the population of far-off Prague—certainly not the Jews in its ghetto—would have ever heard of that acronym. It was ironic, of course, since the "APC" was nothing of the sort. True, Red had mounted some thin armor plate to protect the engine and the driver and gunner in the front seat. But the thing was no solid and heavy coal truck. It was just an old Dodge Ram with a jury-rigged and flimsy-looking rocket launcher fixed in the bed.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">It didn't matter. None of Prague's civilians had ever seen an American war machine before, but they'd heard the rumors. For them, "APC" was more in the way of a spoken talisman than anything else. And this was an age when most common folk believed in the power of talismans and amulets. That was as true for the Jews as the Christians, although the forms were different. The so-called "Book of Raziel the Angel"—the <span class="italic">Sefer Raziel ha-Mal'akh—</span>hadn't been produced yet in printed form, but parts of the ancient manuscript went back to Babylonian Talmudic times. It had drifted around the world's Jewish communities for centuries, never really approved by the rabbinate but never banned either. Morris wouldn't have been surprised to discover that a goodly percentage of the Jews building the barricades had little metal or paper amulets under their clothes, using the formulas of the <span class="italic">Sefer Raziel.</span> </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">When Red finally brought the pickup-cum-katyusha to a halt, after positioning it in the firing slot left open in the barricades, he rolled down the window and gave Morris an admiring look.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"I do declare, perched way up there on that great big horse—hell of a nice plume to the hat, too—you look like the spittin' image of a hidalgo. Damn near a conquistador, in fact."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"My family came from Krakow," Morris groused. "The closest I ever got to Spain was eating tapas once in a restaurant in Philadelphia."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Don't knock it, Morris. All that matters is that you look and act the part. They've got a recognized leader now, instead of everybody fumbling around wondering who's in charge. That'll help steady everybody's nerves—a lot—as long as you don't get yourself shot."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">For some odd reason, the warhorse had a delayed reaction to the Dodge Ram. It was accustomed to the sounds of gunfire, not internal combustion engines, to be sure. But Morris never did figure out why the blasted critter chose the moment when Red turned <span class="italic">off</span> the motor to start getting jittery.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Very jittery. Morris had a few tense and interesting moments, though he managed to stay in the saddle. He did lose the hat, though.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Or fall off the horse," Red added sarcastically. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold">3</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">That evening, after looking for Len all over the Hradcany, Ellie finally figured out where he'd be. She realized it within seconds after she returned to the rooms in the castle that the young commander Kastner had assigned to them. Kastner, worried lest Wallenstein's precious American technical experts might get hurt in the fighting, had insisted that Ellie and Len move from Wallenstein's palace into the greater safety of the fortress above.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">There'd been no point arguing with him. Kastner had no idea how the telephones worked, so he had no intention of trying to use them. In what was coming, Len and Ellie would just be fifth wheels on a cart. So, Len grumbling the whole time, they'd spent the morning hauling their belongings up the hill. Then, having made the last trip alone for a few final items while Len stayed behind in order to arrange their new living quarters, she'd come back to find him gone.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She'd spent most of the afternoon searching for him, growing increasingly worried. But when she finally returned, half-exhausted from endless hiking, she noticed that the lid to one of the chests was cracked open. That chest was normally kept locked, because it was the one where they kept their personal weapons.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She opened the chest and looked. Len's 12-gauge was missing.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">What could he possibly—? </span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">—I'll kill him if the idiot—! </span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Oh. </span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">It all fell into place. Not sure whether she was more relieved than exasperated, Ellie closed the chest and sat down on it. For a moment, half-slumped, she tried to decide what to do. For that matter, what to think.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Then, shrugging, she got up and left. That was her man, when it was said and done. Quirks and foibles and all.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Although even for Len, this is a doozy. </span></p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She found him where she'd thought she would—the one place it had never occurred to her to look the entire afternoon. The place she must have circled at least four times while she searched for him. Impossible not to, of course, since it dominated the Hradcany.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Len was sitting in one of the rear pews in the huge Gothic cathedral. Just staring at the altar, his shotgun across his knees. Ellie was sure he'd been there the whole afternoon. The handful of priests watching him were still nervous, clearly enough, but it was the kind of nervousness that had worn itself down after a few hours. A few hours while the bizarre intruder—monster from another world, with a monstrous weapon—just sat there and did nothing.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She slid into the seat next to him. "You might have left me a note, dammit!"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Len looked uncomfortable. "I started to write one, but . . . I don't know. I didn't know what to say. How to explain it."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie sighed. Then, felt all her exasperation going away. That was the nature of the man, after all. She reached out her hand and stroked the back of his neck.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">" 'S okay. I shoulda figured you'd unlapse your own way. You weird duck. What? You figure on protecting the cathedral all by your lonesome?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She gave the priests a skeptical glance. "I don't think they'd be much help, if Holk's hordes came pouring in. Not that they will, without taking the Hradcany from Kastner. Which they won't."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Len flushed. "It's the principle of the thing, Ellie. Kastner's people didn't want me underfoot anyway, so I figured . . . Look, religious freedom's for everybody. That means Catholics too, even if the bums running the show here screwed up. And this cathedral's ancient. It's a <span class="italic">holy </span>place, even if I don't think much of the current tenants."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">His hand tightened on the stock of the shotgun. "So anybody tries anything . . ."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Ha! Saint Len and the Dragon, is it?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Len's flush deepened. His eyes now seemed riveted on the altar.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Will you marry me?" he asked abruptly. "I've been thinking about it all afternoon."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She studied him for a moment. "I'm not getting married in a fucking church, Len."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"You shouldn't swear in here."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"<span class="italic">Not </span>in a fucking church. I can't stand churches."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Len took a deep breath, sighed. His hand finally left the stock of the shotgun and came up as if to stroke his absent mustache. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Feeling the bare skin, he sighed again. "You are one hard woman, Ellie Anderson."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">There was nothing much she could say, since that was true enough. So she said nothing.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Neither did he, for maybe five minutes. Then, finally, he looked at her. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Was that a 'yes'?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie chuckled and went back to stroking his neck. "Yes, Len, that was a 'yes.' Just not in a fucking church. If you can't live with that, you can't live with me."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She looked at the altar, then at the priests. "But I don't mind if you decide to pull crazy stunts like this, now and then. So I figure we're square."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Okay." He stroked his nonexistent mustache. "I can live with that."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold">4</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The first detachments from Holk's army started showing up in the outskirts of the city early the next morning. By midmorning, they were exchanging shots with Kastner's men forted up in the Hradcany; by noon, with his men forted up in the Malá Strana. By mid-afternoon, most of Holk's ragtag army had poured into the city's west bank—as undisciplined as you could ask for—and decided they'd had enough of cracking their heads against Kastner's troops. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Holk himself showed up then, on his own big warhorse, and led the charge. He waved his sword to the east, very dramatically. <span class="italic">That way! To the Stone Bridge!</span> </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Tanner stayed in the cathedral the whole time, Saint Len faithfully at his post in case the dragon showed up.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie, on the other hand, joined the soldiers on the walls of the Hradcany. She had a better vantage point to see what was happening than Morris and Red did, across the river. So, using her CB, she kept them informed all day of the movements of Holk and his men. Insofar as that rabble could be said to have "maneuvers" at all, other than the mercenary equivalent of Brownian motion.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">When Holk showed up, though, waving his stupid sword, she put down the CB and drew her pistol. Then, cursing a blue streak, clambered up on the wall and emptied the entire clip at him. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">"Where'd you go?" </span>Red asked her, when she got back on the CB. Ellie explained in a few curt sentences, about every other word of which was short and had an Anglo-Saxon pedigree.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Fer chrissake, Ellie—with a 9mm automatic? What're you, nuts? That's gotta be at least six hundred yards. You'd be lucky to hit the river at that range."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"It's the principle of the thing," she stoutly insisted.</p><a></a><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Chapter VI: Discovered Check</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">July, 1633</span></span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_3"><span class="bold">1</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">By the time Holk finally got his men organized—using the term loosely—it was almost sundown. He began to send men onto the Stone Bridge, but the small detachments retreated quickly once they started getting peppered by shots fired from the flintlock-armed men now perched behind the barricade.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">So far as Ellie could tell, looking down on the bridge from the distance of the Hradcany without binoculars, that initial volley—using the term loosely—didn't do more than scare off the thugs. She didn't think a single one of them had even been wounded.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie was sure Morris hadn't ordered the volley. The Stone Bridge had a span of some five hundred yards, with a little dogleg in it about one-third of the way across from the west bank. The flintlocks had started firing as soon as Holk's men made it to the dogleg and came in sight of the barricades—a range of well over three hundred yards. Maybe James Fenimore Cooper's fictional marksman Natty Bumpo could hit something with a flintlock at that range, but ghetto-dwellers with meager experience with firearms hadn't much more chance than Ellie had with her 9mm.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Red confirmed her assessment. "Naw, just buck fever. Morris is fit to be tied. Good thing he ain't a cursing man. He's doing a pretty good job right now of flaying them alive with proper language. He's even waving his sword around." </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie stared at the now-darkening western bank, dumbfounded. "Morris has a <span class="italic">sword</span>?<span class="italic">
</span>Where the fuck did he get a sword?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Red's chuckle crackled in the CB. "Judith had it made up for him, believe it or not. Presented it to him this morning, scabbard and everything. She even had a special scabbard made up so he could sling his rifle on the horse." </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie burst out laughing. "Judith Roth—the gray eminence. It's like they say: 'behind every successful man there's a woman.' "</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"No shit. And you should see the collection of women she's got around her, right here on this end of the bridge. Every prestigious matron in the ghetto, near as I can tell. Oh, sure, they're all being proper as you could ask for—but you can't fool me. Patriarchy be damned. That's the biggest collection of political clout in one city this side of old Mayor Daley's grave."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">A moment later he added, in the satisfied tones of an longtime union agitator: "We're pretty well organized over here, actually. If Morris can just keep those eager beavers from wasting all the ammunition. And if he can keep from stabbing himself with the sword. He handles it like a butcher knife. Except he ain't an experienced butcher. Personally, I wish he'd start swinging the rifle around. THAT he knows what he's doing with." </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Ellie shook her head firmly, even though Red couldn't possibly see the gesture. He was perched in the cab of the Dodge Ram, over half a mile away. "It's the principle of the thing, fella. You don't rally troops with a rifle. You do it with a sword. Haven't you ever seen any movies?"</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Had Judith Roth heard the exchange, she would have disagreed. She was watching Morris also, and while she'd have admitted that he wasn't exactly handling the sword with panache, he was doing a fair job with it nonetheless. There was certainly no danger that he'd stab himself. Cut himself, maybe. Judith had made sure that the sword's tip had been blunted when she ordered it made. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Still and all, everything considered, she thought he looked superb. The horse was magnificent, Morris himself looked very distinguished in his nobleman's garb—the big plumed hat helped a lot—and nobody watching on this side of the river really had any more idea than Morris did how a sword should properly be held anyway. It was enough that he had one and was swinging it around authoritatively while bellowing authoritative-sounding orders.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Most of all, he didn't look afraid. Not in the least. In fact, he looked downright fearless. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">And that was such an odd sensation, for Judith. That her husband was a brave enough man, in those myriad little ways with which people confront the challenges of daily life, Judith had known for many years. But that was the quiet courage of a husband and a father and a countryman, not the same thing at all as the dramatic valor of a commander on the battlefield. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She wasn't really that surprised that Morris could <span class="italic">do </span>it. But she was well-nigh astonished that he could do it so well in public.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">One of the women standing next to her, on the far side of the little square where the barricades had been erected, spoke softly in her ear. "I am very glad your husband is here, gracious lady. And you also."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">That was Eva Bacharach, a woman just about Judith's age. Her brothers Chaim and Napthali were noted rabbis, and Eva herself was the widow of a rabbi who had died almost twenty years earlier. Since her husband Abraham had died, Eva had raised their three daughters and one son, somehow managing at the same time to gain quite a reputation in the ghetto as a noted Hebraist and a scholar in her own right. Even the rabbis were known to consult with her on difficult textual problems.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">When Judith first learned that, from another woman in the ghetto, she'd been so surprised that her expression must have shown it. The woman had chuckled and said dryly: "Gracious lady, we are in Prague, not Amsterdam."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">That short phrase had crystallized Judith's growing conviction that her husband's projected head-on collision with orthodox Judaism needed to be sidetracked before the inevitable train wreck ensued. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">Prague, not Amsterdam. </span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Amsterdam's rabbinate was notorious all over Europe for pigheadedness, intolerance and authoritarianism. Whereas the rabbinate of Prague had been shaped, in the previous century, by one of the few rabbis of the era whose name would be remembered for centuries: Judah Loew ben Bezalel, also known as the Maharal. A man who became a legend in his own time for his learning and wisdom—a legend which only grew after his death. One of the great rabbis of the early modern era, a shaper of the orthodox tradition—yet also conversant with the scientific knowledge of the time and on friendly terms with many of its great scientists. One of his disciples, David Gans—a cousin of Mordechai Spira's friend Isaac—had studied for a time with Tycho Brahe.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">The Maharal.</span> Eva's grandfather, as it happened. And one of Judith's own ancestors.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Judith turned to look at Eva. "I am very glad we are here also. And will be staying. But—please—call me Judith. We are related, you know."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Eva's eyebrows went up. "Oh, yes," Judith said. "I am one of your descendants, Eva Bacharach. Very distant, of course. And also a descendant of your grandfather—I can remember how excited I was when I learned <span class="italic">that.</span>"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Judith laughed softly. "In the world I came from, they even made what we call a 'movie' about him. True, it was because of the legend that grew up that he created the golem. But I knew enough to understand how much more important he was for all his other work."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"The golem!" Eva choked. "That silly story! Do you mean to tell me that—that—in some other world, wherever that may be—people actually <span class="italic">believe </span>it?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Judith wagged her head in a semi-jocular manner. "Maybe yes, maybe no. It's one of those stories that people want to believe, even if they really don't."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Now Eva was laughing softly also. "My grandfather would have been mortified! Ha! The golem!"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">When the laughter ebbed, Eva cocked her head and regarded Judith a bit sideways. "The rabbis will probably need to spend a hundred years—maybe two hundred—chewing on the significance of that other world of yours and what we should think about it all. But since we are women, we are not under their obligations. Much easier for us."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Yes, I agree. Much easier. Quicker, too."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Eva nodded sagely. "Yes. Much quicker."</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Perhaps twenty yards away, on the same side of the square as Judith and Eva, Mordechai Spira and Isaac Gans were also watching Morris.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"We will not be able to ignore this man," Mordechai stated, quietly but firmly. "Never think it, Isaac."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">His friend and fellow rabbi made a little snorting sound. "I didn't think we would. Or should, for that matter. By now, I don't think even Joseph ben Abraham Khalmankhes retains that delusion. Certainly none of the other rabbis do."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Mordechai nodded. "Good. The beginning of wisdom is like everything else. Always the hardest part."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"It won't be so bad," Issac predicted. "In some ways, even good. Complicated, though, yes."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Spira chuckled. " 'Complicated,' applied to this problem, is like saying the sun is bright. Just for a start, do we decide to accept or not those books of young Jason's? It is one thing to respect wisdom. But are we also obliged to respect the wisdom of another universe altogether?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"You know my opinion. Does not the midrash say that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created many universes before this one? Could He not continue to do so?" Gans shrugged. "How can it matter how many universes there are? There is still only one God."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Yes, I know your opinion—and I am inclined to share it. Still . . ."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Mordechai Spira shook his head. "I am not one of those Amsterdam blockheads who finds heresy everywhere he looks. But I started reading that translation you made for me of that one book of Jason's—the one by Mordechai Kaplan—and . . ."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Gans smiled slyly. "It's interesting, though, admit it."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Oh, yes. 'Reconstructionist' Judaism, if you will! The number of schisms our descendants seem to have managed to find." Again, he shook his head. "Almost as bad as Christians."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"On the other hand, there is a lot to admire also. And, whatever else, if Jason's commentaries add to our understanding of Him and his Holy Torah, we must respect them. Subject them to searching analysis and criticism, to be sure, as Rabbi Moshe Ben Nachman did to even Maimonides' work. But respect them nonetheless." Isaac's smile widened. "And the truth is, I am particularly taken by the works of the Chasidim that Jason had with him."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Mordechai cocked a questioning eyebrow. Isaac made a little apologetic gesture with his hand. "Sorry, I haven't had time to translate those yet. But—"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He was interrupted by a commotion on the southern side of the square. As the crowd there parted, Mordechai and Isaac could see that a large group of young men was advancing—somewhat tentatively, almost diffidently—toward the Stone Bridge. All of them were armed, though only a few of them with firearms.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">They were all gentiles, clearly enough. After a moment, Isaac identified them.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Christian students. From the Karolinum."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Mordechai brought his eyes back to Morris Roth. The American don was now trotting his horse toward the oncoming students. He had sheathed his sword and was not projecting an aura of menace. But he nonetheless managed to look authoritative. Very authoritative, in fact.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Spira found himself quite thankful that Don Morris was handling the situation, which could easily become tense. Then, found himself pondering his own reaction. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Indeed, it was so. Don Morris could not be ignored. Nor should he be, even if it were possible. For good or ill, Spira was quite sure that the man would bestride their world in the years to come. Whether as a champion or a menace—or both—remained to be seen. Supported, perhaps; combated, perhaps. Most likely both, Mordechai suspected, at different times. But whatever else, never ignored.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Mordechai and Isaac were too far away to hear the exchange between Don Morris and the Christian students from the Karolinum. But, within a short time, the resolution was obvious. With Don Morris on his warhorse prancing in their lead, the students came to join the Jews already on the barricade. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"So it is," Mordechai stated. "It will be complicated. But you were saying something?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">As he watched the students begin intermingling with the fighters on the barricade, Isaac spoke softly. "There is a lot of wisdom in those pages Jason brought to us, Mordechai. The wisdom of the Chasidic folktales, in particular, I think will serve us well in the time to come."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"And what do those stories relate?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"I will give you two. In the first, a simple wagon-driver stops his cart at the side of the road to speak the Hebrew alphabet, one letter at a time. 'God,' he cries out, 'I don't know the prayers, so I am sending you the alphabet. You must know the prayers. Make them up out of the letters I am sending.' "</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Mordechai barked a laugh. "Oh, I like that! And the other?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Ah, that one is my favorite. It seems one day a disciple came to complain to his teacher. 'Rabbi, some of the congregants are gossiping in the midst of prayer!' "</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Spira smiled crookedly. "Not such a different world after all, then. And the rabbi's response?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">" 'O God,' said the rabbi. 'How wonderful are your people! Even in the midst of gossip, they devote a few moments to prayer!' "</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Shortly thereafter, the first campfires began springing up on the opposite bank of the river. Holk and his men were settling in for the night, it seemed, and would make no further attempt to storm the bridge until the next morning.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">At sundown, Mordechai Spira returned to his home in the ghetto. The fighters would remain on the barricades, keeping watch through the night, with Don Morris there to lead them and keep them steady. But there was no reason for him to remain. Mordechai would return before daybreak, to do what he could. But he wanted to spend this night—perhaps their last—with his family.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Over the dinner, he told the stories to his wife and children. And was still smiling himself when he finally went to bed.</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The rabbi slept soundly that night, but Holk and his mercenaries did not. Jan Billek took advantage of the darkness to move his Brethren forward, from the positions they'd initially taken farther south in the Malá Strana. From their new positions, skirmishers were able to harass Holk's mercenaries all through the night. Occasionally with gunfire, but usually with grenades and swords, in constant probing sallies. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">It was a bitter, nasty sort of fighting. And if none of the Brethren were as nasty as Holk's men, they were considerably more bitter. They had been victimized for years by such men, and were finally able to take some revenge.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">They were also a lot more determined and resolute. Holk's ruffians had come into Prague expecting an easy and pleasant few days of murder, rape, arson and looting. They had not expected to spend their first night in the city worrying about getting their throats cut by dimly seen figures lunging from the darkness—or getting shredded by bomblets suddenly launched into their campfires.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Not all that many of Holk's men were actually killed or wounded that night. Less than a hundred. But none of them slept well, and a considerable number didn't sleep at all.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Except Holk himself. He was drunk by sundown, and comatose by midnight.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold">2</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Okay, Red. Tell Morris they'll be coming any minute. Holk's done with the cursing and he's starting to threaten people with his sword. No, I take it back. I can't see too well from here, but I think he's put the sword away and now he's threatening them with a wheel-lock pistol."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Thanks, Ellie, I'll tell him." Sybolt leaned out of the cab window and hollered the news to Morris. Then, quipped to Dunash in the passenger seat: "It's the old story. 'Go get 'em, boys! You first!' "</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Dunash was too nervous to appreciate the jest. The young man was doing his best to retain his composure—and doing quite well at it—but only by adopting a stern and stiff demeanor. Butter wouldn't melt in his mouth. In fact, Red thought, you could probably use it for an icebox.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Relax, old son. This is gonna be a cakewalk. Trust me."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Dunash made no reply for perhaps half a minute. Then, abruptly, almost harshly: "Why would anyone walk on a cake? And what does that mean, anyway?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Red shook his head ruefully. "Gawd, all the work it's going to take me to recover my reputation as an endless source of wit and wisdom. Oh, well. What it means, Dunash, is that we're going to win this battle. Easily."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Why do you think that?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Red pointed at the roof of the cab. "Because of this thing. Mind you—in general, that is—I think it's about as useless a gadget on the battlefield as you could imagine. I guess the Russians did pretty well with katyushas in the Second World War, but they used jillions of 'em. Just one? Pointless."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Dunash was inordinately proud of the katyusha. "Why?" he asked, in a very aggrieved tone.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"It's an area effect weapon, Dunash. Rockets—sure as hell these—aren't that accurate. If you've got a ton of them the way the Russkies did, that's one thing. Saturation bombardment, they call it. But just one? Pointless. On a battlefield, that is."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Then why did you—"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"On a <span class="italic">battlefield, </span>I said." Red jabbed his finger at the quarter-inch steel plate that covered the windshield except for small viewing slits left for the driver and the gunner. "But that's a bridge, not a battlefield. A bridge that's the only way to cross the Vltava without boats—which Holk didn't think to bring with him, and he can't round up now that he's here because Jan and his boys made sure all the ones in Prague were taken up the river."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Red leaned forward over the steering wheel and peered through the viewing slit. "A bridge that I figure is not more than fifty feet wide and at least five hundred yards long. With no cover on it anywhere—not even the statues that Len says used to be on it hundreds of years from now—and only that one little dogleg way over to the other side of the span. Oh, those poor bastards. They've gotta cross about a quarter of a mile in plain sight with only maybe fifteen of them—okay, make it twenty with that mob—in the front line."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He leaned back, very satisfied. "Would <span class="italic">you </span>want to be one of those fifteen or twenty guys? I sure as hell wouldn't. Not with two hundred flintlocks and a fair number of old-style arquebuses banging away at me." He rapped the roof of the cab with his knuckles. "Not to mention after this baby cuts loose."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Morris won't let them fire until they get within a hundred yards," Dunash pointed out. "So what does the rest of that distance mean?" Sourly, he looked at the firing switches mounted on the dashboard in front of him: "And you won't let me fire this until they get within <span class="italic">fifty </span>yards."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"All it'll take, boy. You watch." He opened the door to the cab and began climbing out. "But now that you bring it up, I better make sure those hotshots of yours didn't fiddle with my instructions."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">They hadn't, although Red was sure they'd been tempted to. Most down-timers, in his experience, even ones with considerable military experience, tended to exaggerate the capabilities of American weapons. Enthusiasts like Dunash's followers, even more so. But the young men tending the rocket launcher in the bed of the pickup had left the settings alone. Even though it must have aggravated them to see that Red had lowered the elevation until the rockets were pointed at the ground right in front of the truck.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Well, almost. Red estimated that the rockets would hit somewhere between fifty and a hundred yards ahead. Exactly what he wanted.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Those rockets could hit the Hradcany from here!" one of them complained, as Red started to clamber down out of the bed.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Once he was back on the ground, Red squinted at the fortress in question. He was still without glasses, so it wasn't much more than a blur to him.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Oh, sure, they can fly that far. But <span class="italic">hit </span>it? Be a pure accident." He pointed toward the Malá Strana. "They'd be just as likely to hit Wallenstein's palace. Just do it my way, boys. Holk's got as much chance of getting across this bridge as a pig does of flying. You watch."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">After he got back into the truck and closed the door, Red cocked his head and smiled at Dunash. "Pigs <span class="italic">can </span>fly, you know."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Dunash frowned; as often, not sure whether Red was kidding or not.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Sure they can," Red insisted. "Throw one off the highest wall in Prague Castle sometime and see for yourself."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The CB squawked. "They're starting the charge, Red! They're on their way!" </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">His eyes came back to the firing slit, as he reached for the CB. "Yup, that pig'll fly. All the way to the ground."</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Only seconds thereafter, Morris could see the first ranks himself, charging across the bridge. Using the term "ranks" very loosely, of course. Holk's men just looked like a mob.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">For a moment, he reached for the sword, ready to start swinging it around again as he bellowed meaningless but reassuringly martial words. But, as if it had a mind of its own, his hand went to the stock of his rifle instead. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He decided his hand was smarter than his brain. So, he drew the rifle out of the saddle holster his wife had had made for him. Then, with motions than were much surer than those with which he held a sword, jacked a round into the chamber and propped the butt of the rifle on his hip.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">And said nothing. He just couldn't think of anything to say, since it was all too obvious. The brigands were coming and he intended to shoot them down. Simple as that. What was there to say about it?</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">His hand <span class="italic">was </span>smarter than his brain. Morris Roth had no way of knowing it—and never would—but the easy and assured motion, and the silence that followed, had precisely the right effect on the men on the barricades. Almost all of whom had been nervously watching him, once they realized the fight was finally underway.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">In truth, it had a much more profound effect than any amount of sword-waving and speechifying could have had, at least with that assemblage of warriors-that-weren't. Shopkeepers, butchers, bakers, students—rabbinical students, some of them. With the exception of a few of the former seamen, who'd dealt with pirates, almost none of them had ever been in a battle before of any kind—much less a pitched battle against an army with as ferocious a reputation as Holk's. True, the tactical situation was completely in their favor, but they didn't really have the experience to know that.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">But Don Morris did—or so, at least, they blithely assumed. He'd <span class="italic">told </span>them they could win, hadn't he? In speech after speech given the day before. And, now that the fury was finally about to fall on their heads, wasn't Don Morris sitting on his saddle not more than ten yards behind the barricade, as calm as could be? Not even bothering with his sword—not even <span class="italic">aiming </span>his rifle. Just . . .</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Waiting.</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He didn't speak until Holk's forces were within two hundred yards. "Fire when I do!" he commanded. Quite sure, this time, that he would be obeyed.</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Red glanced into the side mirror of the pickup. "Shit," he snarled. "Dunash, tell—"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He opened the door. "Never mind, I'll do it myself."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Hopping out of the truck, Red took several steps toward the rear, making broad shooing motions with his arms. "All of you get the hell out of the way!" he bellowed. "The backblast on these rockets is fierce!"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">A number of women and children and old men had started crowding in behind the pickup to get a better look at the oncoming soldiers. They didn't really understand what Red was shouting at them, but they got the gist of it well enough. A moment later, Red had a clear firing lane again.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He clambered back into the truck.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"They're almost here!" Dunash hissed.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Red squinted through the slit. "Oh, bullshit. I can't see the whites of their eyes."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He glanced over and saw that Dunash's hands were twitching, as if they couldn't wait to flip the firing switches.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Whites of their eyes," he growled. "You don't flip those switches till I say so."</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The day before, just to be sure there wouldn't be a problem, Morris had fired the rifle while in the saddle. The warhorse hadn't even flinched.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">When the first of Holk's men was within one hundred yards, Morris brought the rifle butt to his shoulder. He'd removed the telescopic sight the day before, seeing no use for it in the coming fray. Peering over the iron sights, he saw that his guess had been correct. At that range, firing into that mob, he could hardly miss with a blindfold on.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He squeezed the trigger. Oddly, as he did so, thinking only of the horse. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">I wonder if Pappenheim would sell it to me? </span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold">3</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The stern control Morris had managed to gain over his motley troops had its effect. This time, the first volley was actually that—a volley. A single, hammering blow at the enemy, shocking men with its power even more than the actual casualties inflicted.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The casualties themselves were . . . not as good as they could have been, had experienced troops fired that volley. Many of the shots went wild, more than usual with such inaccurate firearms.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">So, Holk's men reeled and staggered, but they came on nonetheless, almost without breaking stride. Granted, these weren't men of the caliber of the great armies of Tilly or Gustavus Adolphus. Holk had known what he was doing when he delayed his arrival at Breitenfeld. On <span class="italic">that </span>battlefield, his thugs would have been coyotes at a wolf party. Still, they were<span class="italic">
</span>mercenary soldiers with fifteen years of the Thirty Years War under their belts. They'd charged into gunfire before, and knew that the only way to get through it was just to plunge ahead, pikes leveled.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">They were all pikemen in the front ranks. The clumsy arquebuses of the seventeenth century would have been almost useless in this kind of charge across a long and narrow bridge. And pikes always had the advantage of sheer terror, in a frontal assault. Outside of a cavalry charge, there was perhaps nothing quite as intimidating as the sight of hundreds of pikes, each of them almost twenty feet long and tipped with a cruel foot-long blade, charging directly at you.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Of course, it would have helped if Holk's men had been able to level the pikes. But, in that pressing mob, with no ranks being maintained, that was impossible for all but the very foremost. The first thing a pikeman learned was that a pike could easily kill or main the man in front of him, if not handled carefully. Those who didn't learn it—and quickly—found themselves out of the army. Sometimes, in a coffin. The term "fragging" didn't exist yet, but nobody had to teach seventeenth-century mercenaries how to deal with a fellow soldier who was a danger to his mates—or a sub-officer, for that matter.</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The second volley was more ragged, but it struck even harder. The range was shorter. Fifty yards. Holk's men were definitely staggering, but still they came on. They had no choice, really, since by now there were thousands of men behind them on the bridge, pushing them forward.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Okay, shoot," Red said quietly.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Dunash's fingers flew to the firing switches.</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">That </span>volley broke the charge. To Holk and his men, it seemed as if a dragon had suddenly belched. Licking down the bridge with a tongue of fire that just seemed to engulf men whole. Swallow entire <span class="italic">ranks </span>of them.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The katyusha was firing the second generation of rockets that Grantville had been able to manufacture in quantity. It was a variation on the old nineteenth-century Hale 24-pounder rotary rocket—2.4 inches in diameter, slightly less than two feet long, with a maximum range of 4000 yards. The propellant as well as the warhead were black powder. The rockets were fired from a single-level rack, twelve tubes mounted side by side on an adjustable framework fixed into the bed of the Dodge Ram.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Red had foreseen the impact of the rockets fired at such close range on such a narrow target. The maximum flight time for a Hale rocket was about twenty seconds, most of it ballistic. At that point-blank range, the Hale rockets struck the advancing troops in split-seconds. But what he hadn't foreseen—was almost aghast when he witnessed it—was the effect of the stone retaining walls on either side of the bridge.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The rockets struck the paving of the bridge, just as Red had foreseen, between fifty and a hundred yards ahead. Some of them exploded instantly, but not most of them. Red had chosen to use contact fuses for this battle instead of the self-lit fuse that had been the standard for the old Hale rockets. But since the somewhat jury-rigged contact fuses available in this day and age made him nervous, he'd adjusted them to fire only in the event they made a direct hit. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Which most of them didn't. They struck the stones at a low glancing angle and kept on, sailing and skidding down the bridge—caroming off the low walls—until they finally ran out of fuel and momentum or hit something solid enough to explode. The narrowness of the bridge concentrated the impact, but it was the walls that channeled it into sheer havoc.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Without uptime propellant the black powder rockets were occasionally prone to explosion—CATO, as the rocket club kids called it ("Catastrophe At Take Off")—caused by an unforeseen bounce or bump that cracked the grain. Then the rockets were little more than large bombs, more black powder burning than could be safely ejected as the pressure rose. Red preferred not to have twenty pounds of black powder exploding near his head, so he'd inspected them carefully. One of them did burst, nonetheless. But that fact didn't make the charging enemy infantry any happier. The rocket exploded some fifty feet in front of the truck and became a huge ball of fire and flying debris hurtling towards Holk's troops at hundreds of miles per hour. A shot of grape from a six-pounder couldn't have been more effective. Grape didn't set the recipient on fire.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Two of the rockets, on the other hand, never exploded at all. Red later found one of them lying on the stones not more than fifty yards from the other end of the bridge. But that didn't matter, either. All twelve of the rockets in that volley did their damage, even those two—and far more damage than Red had foreseen. It was as if the dragon had a dozen serpent tongues, licking down the great Stone Bridge for hundred of yards, racing the length of the span up to the dogleg in less than two seconds. Hissing with fury, belching smoke, upending dozens of terrified men for every one they killed or wounded—which meant dozens of pikes flailing about, gashing and bashing and wounding still more. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The sheer weight of the charge would probably have kept it going, struck only by bullets. Men at the front being shoved forward willy-nilly by those at the rear. But the dragon-tongues ravaged the men in the first hundred yards, paralyzed and confused those behind them—and gave those at the very rear the time to do what soldiers rarely have in a frontal assault. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Time to think things over.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Even the best mercenary soldiers are not given to mindless obedience to orders. And Holk's men were far from the best. The charge staggered to a halt, and the men at the rear began coming back off the bridge. That relieved the pressure on those ahead of them; and, inchoate rank after rank, Holk's charge started disintegrating.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">It took time, of course. Perhaps fifteen minutes, in all. But the critical furious momentum of the initial charge had been lost, and Holk's officers were neither good enough nor respected enough to rally the army. They did manage, four times, to paste together small charges from those men toward the front who could be convinced or cajoled or bullied into it. But the first three of those charges were driven off, easily enough, by the flintlocks and the arquebuses. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">By then, Dunash's rocketeers had been able to reload the katyusha, and the dragon belched again. The fourth charge was shredded, and Holk's men had had <span class="italic">enough. </span>This was even worse that the Hradcany. They hadn't signed on to fight a damn dragon.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">So, back they came, in a hurry, leaving hundreds of dead and dying and wounded behind them on the bridge. Two of the corpses were those of sub-officers, too stupid or inexperienced to understand when it was time to stop trying to force mercenary soldiers to do something they really, really, really didn't want to do any more. One of them bled to death from no fewer than five stab wounds.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold">4</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">"For Chrissake, Red, it's obvious even from here. Tell Morris to quit screwing around with his stupid modesty act and start waving his hat. And while he's at it, do the Roy Rogers bit with the fucking horse. Y'know, rearing up on the hind legs. Whatever they call that silly stunt, I don't know. I can't stand big fucking animals. Damn things are dangerous. Even cats make me nervous, with their fangs and shit." </span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold">5</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">After Red whispered in his ear—well, shouted in his ear—Morris did take off his big, wide-brimmed plumed hat and wave it around, acknowledging the enthusiastic roars of approval from the crowd. He drew the line, though, at rearing the horse.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">It didn't matter, really. Ellie was too nervous about a lot of things. After that sunny day in Prague, in July of the year 1633—as Christians counted it; for the Jews who made up most of the crowd it was the month of Av and the year was 5393—it wouldn't have mattered if Don Morris had fallen off the horse entirely—or lost his hat in the river.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Don Morris, he was; and Don Morris he would always remain. For them as well as their descendants who heard the tale. It had been a long time, after all—a very long time—since the Ashkenazim of central and eastern Europe had had a martial hero of their own. The ancient Hebrews had had a multitude, of course; and the Sephardim, in their Iberian heyday, more than a few. But for the Ashkenazim of Europe, for many centuries, heroism had been something that could only be measured by martyrs.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Martyrs were to be cherished, certainly. But it was nice—delightful, in fact—not to have to do it again.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">And who was to say? Perhaps never again. There were those other men, after all, who would outlive Don Morris. The much younger Jews who looked very bold and handsome, perched up there on that strange thing that was so much bigger and more deadly than a mere horse. And didn't seem to be afraid of it at all.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Perhaps the golem was not simply a silly legend. The Maharal had been a <span class="italic">very </span>wise man. One of the wisest, even in a city of wise men like Prague.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold">6</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">As usually happens in history, the famous Battle of the Bridge didn't have a neat ending. Holk and his men never tried to charge across the bridge again. But they did remain in Prague for days thereafter, burning and plundering what they could in the Malá Strana.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">One part of the plan had not worked. Billek and his Brethren had tried—quite valiantly—to trap Holk's army on the bridge and slaughter them wholesale. But Holk had twice as many men in his army as he could get onto the bridge in one charge, and if he was a drunk and a brute he was not actually incompetent. So, he'd stationed half his army to protect the western entrance to the bridge, and the Brethren were unable to drive them off. Indeed, they suffered fairly heavy casualties in the attempt. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">And continued to suffer them, the next day. The crude fact, soon evident, was that Billek's inexperienced volunteers simply couldn't stand toe-to-toe with Holk's toughs in a pitched battle. They tried, the next morning, fighting in the open in the streets, but by noon Billek realized his mistake and ordered a retreat. Thereafter, in the days that followed, the Brethren went back to their tactics of harassment and fighting from well-fortified positions. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">At that, they were extremely capable—just as their Hussite ancestors, from the shelters of their armored wagons, had been very good at breaking noble cavalry. They couldn't defeat Holk—couldn't even drive him off—but they could certainly bleed him. And, what was most important, bleed the morale of his army.</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris, during those same days, lapsed frequently into profanity. Understandably enough, having driven off the charge across the bridge on the first day and being in no real danger thereafter, the Jews of the ghetto were reluctant to get involved in the fighting still taking place in the Malá Strana. That was a goyishe battle in a goyishe part of the city where few of them had ever gone, and fewer still had ever lived. All of Morris' attempts to plead and convince and cajole them—even curse them, which he did more than once—had little effect.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">But Dunash and his young firebrands came into their own, during those same days. They <span class="italic">did </span>participate in the fighting. First, at irregular intervals, by racing onto the bridge—almost all the way across, on one occasion—and firing rocket volleys at Holk's encampment. Then, racing off before Holk's cannons could retaliate. (Holk had finally brought in his artillery, three days too late to do any good.)</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Secondly, perhaps more importantly, every day after sundown at least some of Dunash's men made their way across the river in a few small boats that they'd kept safely hidden away. Once there, they joined the Brethren in their nightly harassment of Holk's forces. In purely military terms, they were not much of a factor. But the political effect was significant—and, by the fourth day, was starting to result in a steady trickle of recruits to Dunash's miniature army. In any population of fifteen thousand people, there are a fair number of bold youngsters who don't see things the way their sage elders do.</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Most of the Malá Strana was in ruins, by the end, though civilian casualties were minimal. Fortunately, the inhabitants of that section of Prague had fled before Holk arrived. For that matter—much to the disgruntlement of Holk's troops—they'd taken their valuable belongings with them. The destruction wreaked by Holk's army during the week it spent in Prague was not so much due to looting, as such; it was simply the mindless destruction and arson visited upon a town by frustrated and angry troops. Who became even more frustrated, the more they wrecked and burned, because their own living quarters and rations got steadily worse as a result.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Holk would have tried to restrain them, had he not been Heinrich Holk. Being Holk, it never once occurred to him to do so.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Then, a week after the siege of Prague began, word came from the southwest. A second battle of the White Mountain had indeed been fought. Actually, the battle was fought a good twenty miles away from the White Mountain, but since victors get to name battles, "the Second Battle of the White Mountain" it was.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">It seemed that Wallenstein thought it made a nice touch, to inaugurate the new kingdom of Bohemia and Moravia.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Oh, yes. He'd won. Pappenheim and his dreaded Black Cuirassiers had pursued the retreating Austrians for miles, slaughtering pitilessly.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Practicing for Holk," Pappenheim was reported to have said afterward.</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The news arrived in the morning. By late afternoon, Holk's army was out of Prague, racing for the north. Holk, it was said, had already opened negotiations with the Elector of Saxony, John George, looking for a new employer. And shelter from the coming storm.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold">7</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">But there was no storm on the day that Wallenstein and Pappenheim finally returned to Prague—other than a storm of applause from the residents of the city who greeted his victorious army, on both banks of the river. Whatever private reservations any of them had regarding the change of power, nobody was willing any longer to speak out in open opposition.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Not even the Catholics in the city. First, because the Jesuits dominated the Catholic church in Bohemia. Wallenstein had always been partial to the Jesuits, and had sent them a friendly private note assuring them that they would be able to remain in Prague unmolested—provided, of course, they agreed to cease and desist their activities against Protestants on behalf of the Austrian Habsburgs.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The Jesuits hadn't decided yet, how they would react to that last provision. But they didn't have to fear for their own lives in the immediate period.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The second reason they decided to stay, however, and abide by Wallenstein's conditions—at least for the moment—would have amazed Ellie Anderson. Whatever she thought of Len Tanner's behavior during the siege, the Jesuits had reacted otherwise. Quirky—even foolish—he might have been. But, as the days passed and the pudgy American kept returning to his self-assigned post of duty in the cathedral, always with that bizarre weapon in his hands, the Jesuits came to the conclusion that whatever Wallenstein might think, his new American allies had their own opinions. And, whatever else, were clearly stubborn about them.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">That was an interesting datum, with interesting possibilities for the future. The Jesuits in Prague duly recorded their impressions in several letters they sent to their Father General in Rome, Mutio Vitelleschi. They did so, of course, in the full knowledge that Vitelleschi was close to the Pope and would pass along their letters. The gist of them, in any event. So, the Jesuits would be patient. They were trained, and accustomed, to thinking in the long run.</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Most of the crowd gathered to cheer Wallenstein's army, however, were Protestants of one sort or another—counting the Brethren and the Utraquists in their number, although they predated Martin Luther—and the Jews. Those people were far less ambivalent about the situation. Granted, Wallenstein was still an enigmatic figure, and a somewhat unsettling one. But the Habsburgs weren't enigmatic at all. Most of Prague's residents had had more than enough of the royal bigot Ferdinand II, sitting on his throne in Vienna. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">And, finally, there was this: Wallenstein did not return alone. He had Pappenheim, of course, but he also brought with him tangible proof that his new regime had secured at least one redoubtable ally: the United States in Thuringia, if not perhaps the entire Confederated Principalities of Europe. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The proof came in the form of two APCs that Mike Stearns sent to Bohemia the minute he got word from Morris Roth—yes, there had been a long-distance radio stashed in that great mansion's basement, along with so many other treasures—that the political crisis had finally erupted and it was time for the United States to forego all secrecy. The APCs had not arrived in time to play any role at the second battle of the White Mountain, but they did arrive in time to join Wallenstein's triumphal procession back into Prague.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The only unfortunate episode in the day's celebrations—and that, only mildly unfortunate—was that the biggest cheer of all was not reserved for Wallenstein himself. That cheer erupted, quite spontaneously, when the two APCs from Grantville rumbled onto the Stone Bridge from the Malá Strana side and were met halfway by the katyusha coming from the east bank. Now that they could see what a <span class="italic">real </span>APC looked like, almost dwarfing the katyusha drawn up before it, Prague's citizens were greatly heartened. Their own little one had driven off Holk, no? Who knew what the big ones could do?</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Best of all, perhaps—at least for fifteen thousand of the city's residents—was that the katyusha was festooned with banners. One—the largest, of course—was Wallenstein's new banner. But there was also, resting alongside it, the banner of the Josefov. The central image on the flag was that of a hexagram—a symbol that had, in another universe, evolved over the centuries into the Star of David. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">There was something very fitting about it all, they thought. So far as anyone knew, Prague had been the first city in Europe whose Jews were given the right to fly their own flag. They had been given that right in the Christian year 1354—by the same Emperor Charles IV who had built the Stone Bridge it was now flying over, and which that katyusha had so valiantly defended.</p><p class="calibre_7">* * *</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Uriel Abrabanel had returned also, with the APCs. He'd come onto the bridge with the war machines, but he'd kept going, walking all the way across.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris came out of the crowd to greet him. " 'Bout time you got back," he grumbled. "Where were you when all the dust was flying?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Uriel grinned, quite unabashed. "I was busy. Never mind with what, I won't tell you. Besides, flying dust is no place for a proper spy. That's the business of princes and soldiers—and hidalgos, I hear."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Just what I need. More rumors." Morris made a face. "So? Are you staying?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Certainly. Spies are all mercenaries at heart, you know. I also hear that the new hidalgo in Prague is a very generous patron."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris sighed. "Et tu, Brute? Soak the rich Jew, that's all anybody thinks about. Even other Jews."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Stop whining. You need a good spy. Better yet, a good spymaster."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris thought about it. Not for very long. "Boy, isn't that the truth? Okay, Uriel, you're hired."</p><a></a><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">Chapter VII: End Game</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">August, 1633</span></span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_3"><span class="bold">1</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"That is a ridiculous price for that horse." Pappenheim was smiling when he said it, though. A rather cold and thin smile, true, but—</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">From Pappenheim, that was good enough.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"All I can afford," Morris insisted. "It's not the horse that's the problem, Gottfried, it's the cost of feeding the great brute."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"And that statement is even more ridiculous. Not about the horse's appetite—I know what that costs—but the rest of it."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Pappenheim's eyes ranged up and down Morris' figure, examining his apparel. "What, no pearls? They're quite in fashion, I'm told, in Paris and Vienna—and you needn't worry about the sumptuary laws any longer, because the King of Bohemia has abolished all of them."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Morris was tempted to state that was because Wallenstein was a clotheshorse himself, but he wisely refrained. It <span class="italic">was </span>an autocracy, after all, even if Morris Roth was about as well-respected and well-regarded a courtier—in Bohemia, at least—as any in Europe. And he didn't even have to fawn all over his monarch to maintain the status. Clotheshorse or not, Wallenstein was far more interested in results than flattery.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Pappenheim rose from his chair. "Oh, let's be done with it. Morris, I give you the horse as a gift. In fact, I'll even include a full set of cuirassier armor to go with it. In recognition of your valor at the bridge."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He grinned at Morris' startled expression. "Don't worry. I promise I won't hold it against you if you never wear it. Miserable heavy stuff, I'll be the first to admit."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"It's not you I'm worried about, Gottfried," Morris replied. "It's my wife. She'll never let me leave it stuffed safely away in a chest. You watch. The first big ceremonial occasion—eek."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">How Pappenheim could manage a grin that wide, and that cold, Morris would never understand.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Indeed so," said the Duke of Moravia. "The coronation is less than two weeks from now. Still, that's more than enough time for me to have the armor ready. Do try your best not to trip during the procession, Morris. You'll never get up again, not at your age. Without a winch."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold">2</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">That night, Jason came back from his first Shabbat dinner at the home of Mordechai Spira.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He seemed in a peculiar mood, and said very little before he went to bed. Morris didn't notice, but Judith did. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">The next morning, she pressed Jason about it.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"I don't know. It's hard to explain. A lot of it I liked—a lot. The discussion was almost exhilarating at times. The rabbi was at his best, too. I learned a lot and I laughed a lot at the same time. But . . ."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">He ran fingers through his hair, which had gotten very long. "I don't know if I'll ever get used to men dancing alone. And it was weird, having the women do all the serving and cooking as if they were menials. Although I was even more surprised—pleased, but surprised—when the women participated in the Talmudic discussion after dinner. I didn't think they would."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Judith was surprised herself, hearing that. Although . . .</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She reminded herself not to make the mistake her husband Morris was prone to making. People are not categories, not even categories to which they belong. Unusual rabbis were still rabbis, after all. So why should it really be that surprising—in the same city which had produced a woman like Eva Bacharach—that the wife and daughters of Mordechai Spira would be unusual women?</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"One of the rabbi's daughters even made a joke in the course of it," Jason continued. "Pretty funny one, too."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">His eyes got a little unfocused. Judith had to struggle not to smile.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Tell me about her. The daughter, I mean."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Jason mumbled some vague phrases. The only ones that weren't hopelessly murky had to do with the girl's eyes—very bright, apparently—and the fact that her name was Sarah.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">But Judith let it go. There was no reason to pursue the matter with Jason, at the moment, since it obviously made him uncomfortable. Eva Bacharach would be coming for a visit later that day. Judith could find out everything she needed to know from her. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"I just don't know what to think," he complained. "Everything seems gray, and complicated. It's confusing."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"And you think that'll change? It won't. Trust me. But for the moment—"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">She gave the young man a very warm smile. "Welcome to your life, Jason Gotkin."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_4"><span class="bold">3</span></p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">In late afternoon, Mordechai Spira visited his friend Isaac Gans.</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">After seeing Mordechai to a chair, Gans sat in his own. </p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"And?"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"You were quite wrong, Isaac. Sarah didn't start pestering me until after lunch."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Ha!" Isaac chuckled. "That's because she spent the whole morning conspiring with your wife."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"I know," said Mordechai gloomily. His eyes moved to the books on Isaac's study table. "It's a puzzling and tangled problem, given who the fellow is. But I'm sure I can find something in the Talmud—perhaps the responsa—to guide me properly."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Of course you can. Everything pertaining to proper conduct is contained somewhere in the Talmud or the midrash or the responsa. I'm more the scholar than you are, though I don't have your stature as a judge." Stoutly: "So I will be glad to help!"</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Gans leaned forward, spreading his hands wide. "But we must begin by facing the truth, Mordechai my old friend. We're rabbis. Studying the sacred texts takes time—hours and hours, days and weeks, poring over the words—and we are dealing with women."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">Spira grimaced ruefully. "They're quick."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Indeed. And so, I think, are these new times. We will just have to do our best."</p><a></a><p class="calibre_6">"Always."</p><a></a><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_7"><span class="bold">THE END</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_7"><span class="bold">For more great books visit</span><br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><a href="http://www.webscription.net"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_10"><span class="underline">http://www.webscription.net</span></span></span></a></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_17"></div>
